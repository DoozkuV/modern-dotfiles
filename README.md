# Dotfiles
Here is my personal dotfiles. They are managed with [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm). Here is how to use them.

1. Make sure you have all the necessary programs installed, including *yadm*. 
2. Run `yadm clone` to get a copy of the repo. 
3. Run `yadm boostrap` to get everything set up
